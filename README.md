# API-RUST

Api programmed in the Rust language with connection to a MySql database hosted on GCP.

## Part 1.
In this series of posts I will explore how to access MySQL from Rust. We will start simple and in later parts finish with developing a web service API.<br><br>
The MySQL client API is quite easy to use. I love the way it converts data to whatever type you want to work with. Here we have used i32, String, and NaieveDate. This should cover the most common data types used in database programming.
