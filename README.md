# API-RUST

Api programmed in the Rust language with connection to a MySql database hosted on GCP.<br>
To test each piece of code, you can comment and uncomment the blocks to interact with them and practice as you like.
<br><br>

## Part 1.
In this series of posts I will explore how to access MySQL from Rust. We will start simple and in later parts finish with developing a web service API.<br><br>
The MySQL client API is quite easy to use. I love the way it converts data to whatever type you want to work with. Here we have used i32, String, and NaieveDate. This should cover the most common data types used in database programming.

## Part 2.
In part 1 I discussed how to do basic query. In this article we will learn to do inserts and updates. We will continue to work with the PUBLICATION table.<br><br>
In this part we learned to do insert, update and delete. Go to Part III where we will build a proper data access layer.
